    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Engraving is the practice of incising a spell into a hard, flat surface, by using hand tools to cut grooves into it. Precious metals such as gold and silver are traditionally used, as is glass for its relative inexpensiveness and sharpness of image. Select pieces of hardwoods are also used, such as lemon-wood or cherry, but must be selected and cut especially for engraving. Spells that are engraved do not have a cast limit, as they are permanently scribed into the hard material, but the engraving process is long and arduous, taking 10 times the amount of time it would take to write out the spell. Engravings can also be done for another mage, provided that they consent to the engraving and assist in it’s creation, provided they have at least 1 rank in the spellschool, and the SP cost is no more than double the recipient’s total modifier in the spellschool, rounded down.</span> <br style=\" font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; \"></p>"
