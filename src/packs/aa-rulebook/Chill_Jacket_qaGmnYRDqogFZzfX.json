    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">A chill jacket is a jacket worn by any creature that needs to stay cold, with small cold diffusers built within the lining of the jacket, keeping the wearer cool, while appearing like a normal jacket. For the purpose of polarans, it works as a chill collar, and grants +2 to Fortitude Saving Throws made to resist the effects of hot weather. For anyone else, it will reduce the effects of hot weather as if the wearer were in a single lower level of temperature. This jacket requires a coolant pack to stay cool. The coolant pack lasts indefinitely. Chill jackets have two pockets than can hold 1.5 lbs of equipment that is Tiny sized or smaller each.</span> <br style=\" font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; \"></p>"
