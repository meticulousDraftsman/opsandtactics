    "description": "<h1>Knowledge (INT) Trained Only</h1><p>This skill allows a character to be knowledgeable in a particular area of lore.</p><p>A character makes a Knowledge check to see if the character knows something. When trying to determine what Knowledge skill a particular question or field of expertise falls under, use a broad interpretation of the existing categories. When answering a question, the TN for answering within the character’s field of study varies by the difficulty of the question asked.</p><p>Knowledge checks can also be used to create opportunities that would otherwise not exist, if the character was not knowledgeable in the area.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>Question/Opportunity</strong></p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>TN</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Very Easy</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">5</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Easy</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Basic</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">15</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Difficult</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">20</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Hard</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">25</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Very Hard</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">30</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Nearly Impossible</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">40</p></td></tr></tbody></table><h1>Business </h1><p>Business procedures, investment strategies, and corporate structures. Bureaucratic procedures and how to navigate them. Understand business concepts, procedures, terms, and best practices, as well as all of the exploitative loopholes in business.</p><p>Business can give a synergy bonus to purchasing all items. The character receives a 5% discount, rounded up, on all New-in Box purchases of all items, for every synergy bonus they receive from this skill. This applies to any new in box item the character purchases, and applies after any other discounts are given.</p><h3>Synergies</h3><p>A Synergy is a representation of knowledge that can aid someone in completing a task. When a character puts ranks in any knowledge skill, they can choose the skill that they wish for the synergy to go to immediately.</p><p>For every +4 total skill modifier the character has in that knowledge skill, and they have at least 1 rank in that knowledge skill, they receive a +1 miscellaneous bonus to the selected skill.</p><h3>Multiple Synergies</h3><p>A character can have multiple synergies for a single skill. When this is the case, you simply add all of the synergy bonuses and add them to the selected skill.</p><h3>Special</h3><p>An untrained Knowledge check is simply an INT check. Without actual training, a character only knows common knowledge about a given subject.</p><p>A character can take 10 when making a Knowledge check.</p><h3>Try Again?</h3><p>No. The check represents what a character knows and thinking about a topic a second time doesn’t let the character know something they never knew in the first place.</p><h3>Time</h3><p>A Knowledge check can be a reaction, but otherwise costs 12 Combat Points.</p>",
