    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Magical materials are materials that act counter to standard material behavior, and have properties that are beneficial and desired. When upgrading or building a weapon out of a magical material, the contact, the handle, or both, may be built out of the material, so long as the contact or handle is made or can be made from a comparable material. The price increase is per contact, or handle; making a weapon out of both doubles this cost. Nonballistic ammunition can also be made of these materials, the cost of this being for one full set of what is sold (for example, Arrows are sold in sets of 20 arrows). The cost is for a single area. When upgrading materials on a weapon, no upgrade points are used and the weapon retains it’s full prior upgrades that were on it previously.</span></p><p>The WP cost and weight listed in the item's statistics is the cost and weight for a Medium sized ingot of the material.</p><p></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">This ultra hard base metal is found deep in the center of mountains near deposits of iron. Any piercing or slashing weapon with a metal contact can have a contact made of adamantine, granting a +3 damage bonus to the base damage stats of the weapon, and increasing the weapon’s weight by 150% per area, and increasing the weapon’s cost by 500% per area. Adamantine weapons also destroy armor at a faster rate. The AP lost from an adamantine weapon is doubled. Adamantine also grants the weapon one additional upgrade point, per contact or handle, wherever it is installed</span> <br style=\" font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; \"><br style=\" font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; \"></p>"
