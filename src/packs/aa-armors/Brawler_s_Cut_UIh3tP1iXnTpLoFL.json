The vest has small, light metal plates sewn into the chest and back of the vest (to protect against slashing weapons) which are then lined with a non-Newtonian fluid to help absorb the shock of bludgeoning weapons. It is further reinforced to take more damage than a standard vest. It also has hidden pockets that contain a holster-sheath that will hold one Small or smaller sized weapon, and a pouch that can hold 2 magazines or speedloaders.</p>",
