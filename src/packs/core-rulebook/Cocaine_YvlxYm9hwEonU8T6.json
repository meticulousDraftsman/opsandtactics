    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Cocaine is the processed version of the coca plant, used as a strong stimulant. It is primarily used as a recreational drug. A character may ingest, inject, or inhale one dose of cocaine (0.01 lb) to gain 5 additional Combat Points every round for 1 minute. The character may ingest, inject, or inhale subsequent doses to lengthen the time this bonus lasts by 1 minute, but it does not grant any additional Combat Points. After each dose is ingested, injected, or inhaled, a character immediately makes a Fortitude Saving Throw [TN25]. If a character fails this Saving Throw, they take CHP damage equal to the Combat Point bonus they received. The TN increases by 5 for each dose of Cocaine taken within 6 weeks of the first dose. There are 8 doses in 0.1 lbs of cocaine. Any amount less than 8 doses is considered weightless</span> <br style=\" font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; \"></p>"
