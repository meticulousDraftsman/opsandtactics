    "description": "<p>The concealable plasma vest is a light, comfortable vest that is worn normally under clothing primarily to defend against plasma attacks. This armor can soak 15 points of plasma or electric damage before it requires a new coolant pack. This armor protects against all stunning effects from any attack that also deals electric damage while the armor can soak plasma or electric damage. It takes 3 rounds for the plasma shields to recharge after a new coolant pack has been inserted.</p>\n<h3>Special Notes</h3>\n<p>This armor is hardened against EMP</p>",
