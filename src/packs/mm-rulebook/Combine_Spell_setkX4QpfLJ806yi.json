The allowed combinations in Abjuration are Damage Reduction and Saves, Energies, and Elements. In Conjuration, Healing. In Divination, Enhance Sight and Enhance Speech. In Enchantment, Enchanting Objects and Enchanting Aetherwands. In Illusion, Distort Sight and Distort Sound. All normal rules for stacking spells apply. This modifier adds 1 SP per combined spell to each spellâ€™s cost.</span></p>",
