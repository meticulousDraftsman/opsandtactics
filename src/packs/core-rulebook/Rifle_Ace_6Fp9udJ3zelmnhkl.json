This attack may be any standard attack, and may not use any called shot attack modifiers. This attack can not cost more than 8 Combat Points. Both of these attacks are resolved at the same time. Also, when readying an attack with an assault, battle, carbine, or target rifle, or sub-machine gun the Combat Point cost is 2 less.</p><h3>Special</h3><p>If a character selects the Rifle Ace Feat, they may not select the Rifle Expert Feat.</p>",
