    "description": "<h1>Craft (INT)</h1><p>You are skilled at making various objects and substances. This skill encompasses several categories, each of them treated as a separate skill: Chemical, Electronics, Mechanical, Pharmaceutical, Structural, Visual Arts, and Writing.</p><p>Craft skills are specifically focused on creating objects. To use a Craft skill effectively, a character must have a kit or some other set of basic tools. The WP cost of this equipment varies according to the particular Craft skill.</p><p>To use Craft, first decide what the character is trying to make and consult the category descriptions below. If the character has enough WP to purchase the raw materials, make the Craft check against the given TN for the object in question. If the character fails the check, they do not make the object, and the raw materials are wasted (unless otherwise noted).</p><p>Generally, a character may take 10, when using a Craft skill to construct an object. A character may take 10 on a repair check or accomplish a jury-rig repair. Multiple attempts may be attempted, stacking on the previous attempt, each time using the same amount of raw materials each time, taking the same amount of time and adding each subsequent roll together, until the TN is achieved or the character chooses to stop.</p><p>The character may try as many times as they like, as long as they can afford the raw materials cost for each attempt.</p><h1>Craft (Writing)</h1><p>This skill allows a character to create short stories, novels, scripts and screenplays, newspaper articles and columns, and similar works of writing. When creating a work of writing, the player simply makes a Craft (Writing) check, the result of which determines the quality of the work. The WP cost is negligible.</p><p>Creating a work of writing requires at least 1 hour, but usually takes a day, a week, or more, depending on the scope of the project.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Skill Check Result</strong></p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Effort Achieved</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">0-9</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">Untalented Amateur</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">10-19</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">Talented Amateur</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">20-24</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">Professional</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">25-30</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">Expert</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">31+</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">Master</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>This skill also allows a knowledgeable character to create reference books, that can be used by other characters to bolster their knowledge in subjects. The player selects a single Knowledge skill that they have ranks in, makes a Craft (Writing) check, and spends 1 week writing the reference book. The reference book grants a bonus to the selected Knowledge skill, equal to 1/10th of their total modifier of the knowledge skill selected, rounded down. The result of the Craft (Writing) check determines the amount of useful knowledge contained in the book, and thus, how many times a single character can use the book. Only characters that have a Knowledge skill modifier of 5 or less than the creator of the of the reference manual, at the time of creation, can use the specific reference manual.</p><table><tbody><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Skill Check Result</strong></p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\"><strong>Number of Uses</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">0-9</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">1</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">10-19</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">3</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">20-24</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">6</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">25-30</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">10</p></td></tr><tr><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">31+</p></td><td><p style=\"text-align: center\">15</p></td></tr></tbody></table>"
