    "description": "<h1>Drive (DEX)</h1><p>The character is trained how to drive in unusual circumstances, such as inclement weather, or during a dramatic situation, such as being chased, or attempting to reach a location quickly. A character does not need any ranks in drive in order to drive a civilian car, truck, or motorcycle. When driving, the character can attempt simple maneuvers or stunts.</p><h3>Special</h3><p>A character can take 10 when driving.</p><p>There is no penalty for operating a general-purpose motor vehicle. Other types of motor vehicles (heavy wheeled, powerboat, sailboat, ship, and tracked) require the corresponding Surface Vehicle Operation feat, or the character takes a âˆ’4 penalty on Drive checks.</p><h3>Try Again?</h3><p>Most driving checks have consequences for failure that make trying again impossible.</p><h3>Time</h3><p>A Drive check costs 6 Combat Points.</p>"
