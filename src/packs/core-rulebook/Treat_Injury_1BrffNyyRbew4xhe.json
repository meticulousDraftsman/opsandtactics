    "description": "<h1>Treat Injury (WIS) </h1><p>The character knows how to use first aid kits to restore health, treat poison, and stabilize characters.</p><p><strong>Long Term Care [TN20]</strong> With a first aid kit this check allows a patient to restore CHP, XHP, and Ability Points at an advanced rate, 3HP/3AP per character level, per full day of rest. A new check is required each day. You can tend to as many patients as you have ranks. The patient must spend all their time resting and the user must dedicate 30 minutes of care per day per patient.</p><p><strong>Restore Hit Points [TN20]</strong> With a first aid kit you can restore 1d4+1 CHP or XHP per character level of the user, to a character. CHP is always restored first. This may be done only once per day per character. This costs 12 Combat Points.</p><p><strong>Stop Bleeding [TN10]</strong> With a first aid kit or applicable supplies you can stop a character from bleeding. This removes 2 bleed dice. For every 4 points the character achieves beyond the TN, they heal an additional bleed dice. This costs 8 Combat Points.</p><p><strong>Revive a Dazed, Stunned, or Unconscious Character [TN17]</strong> With a first aid kit you can remove the Dazed, Stunned, or Unconscious condition from a character. You can’t revive a character that is at −1 or lower CHP without stabilizing them first. This costs 8 Combat Points.</p><p><strong>Stabilize Dying Character [TN15]</strong> With a first aid kit you can tend to a dying character. The character stops losing HP. This costs 8 Combat Points. Unlike the other actions, this action cannot be performed without a first aid kit.</p><p><strong>Surgery [TN25]</strong> With a surgery kit you can conduct field surgery, allowing you to realign broken bones, remove bullets or shrapnel, and stitch up grievous wounds. Surgery restores 1d6 CHP or XHP per 2 skill modifiers the character has in Treat Injury, heals all extremity damage, and removes all bleed damage. CHP is always restored first. Undergoing surgery causes fatigue for 24 hours, minus 2 hours for every point above the TN the surgeon achieves. Surgery requires 1d4 hours plus one hour for each point the character’s CHP has fallen below 0.</p><p><strong>Treat Poison [TN15]</strong> With a first aid kit, you make a check when a poisoned character makes a Fortitude Saving Throw against a poison’s secondary effect. If you succeed, you remove the secondary effect from the posioned character immediately. In the case of multiple secondary effects, you remove the last one taken. This costs 8 Combat Points.</p><h3>Try Again?</h3><p>Yes for restoring HP, reviving Dazed, Stunned, or Unconscious characters, stabilizing dying characters, stop bleeding and surgery. No for all other uses of the skill.</p><h3>Time</h3><p>Treat Injury checks take different amounts of time based on the task at hand.</p>"
