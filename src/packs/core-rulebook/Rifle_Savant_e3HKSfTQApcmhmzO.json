This attack may be any standard attack, and may not use any called shot attack modifiers. This attack can not cost more than 8 Combat Points. Both of these attacks are resolved at the same time.</p><h3>Special</h3><p>If a character has the Rifle Ace Feat, they may use the Rifle Savant three times per round, instead of once per round. If a character selects the Rifle Savant Feat, they may not select the Rifle Master Feat.</p>",
