    "description": "<h3>Aetherweapons</h3><p>Aetherweapons are split into three categories based on their capacity; Aetherrods, Aetherstaves, and Aetherwands, which are magical objects that have been formatted by an enchantment spell to receive spells and recast them as if they were cast from a mage. When a aetherweapon has completely expended all of its spell uses it returns to normal and has to be reformatted again and then re-enchanted. Aetherweapons are considered simple weapons. Unlike written spells, they can be cast by anyone, usually by either pressing a sigil, or by speaking a command word, which is usually printed on the object.</p><h3>Aetherrods</h3><p>A rod can be created from any rod-like object that is between 13’’-36’’. An Aetherrod can hold two spells which can be used a combined 15 times before it has to be reformatted and re-enchanted. Use of either spell uses one of the uses that the rod has. The rod listed in the chart is a pre-formatted three foot long rod made of oak.</p>"
