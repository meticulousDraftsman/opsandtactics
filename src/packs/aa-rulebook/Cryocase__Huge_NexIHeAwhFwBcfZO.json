    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">This case bears a very similar look to the aluminum cases, only scaled up more so. Inside, however, it is very different. The cryocase is a hermetically sealed, cryogenic case that has an adjustable, built-in life support system. Commonly used for foods with a very short shelf life, it has the fortunate ability to transport people, but not their gear, safely over long distances with no perceived time in between. The cryocase has 10 hours worth of life support when fully charged, before its contents begin to die. Any creature that is in the sealed cryocase when its life support ends immediately begins to suffocate. A huge cryocase can fit a Medium creature or 200 lbs of objects that are Large or smaller size.</span> <br style=\" font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; \"></p>"
