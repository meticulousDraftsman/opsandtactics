You can cast a spell using that spellschool without writing it down first, that cost up to ½ of the total selected spellschool score, rounded down. This spell must be cast from the caster’s stylus by drawing runes in the air, and they must have the stylus in hand to cast the spell. This spell can not use any benefits from any inks or papers, and you must have the Mental Limit to cast the spell as if it was written down. Stylus spells are considered released spells, and the Combat Point cost is the same as releasing a written spell</span>.</p><h3>Special</h3><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">This feat may be taken multiple times. It applies to a different Spellschool skill each time. You may take the benefits of any feats that reduce cost of spells, that does not require the spell to be written down</span></p>",
