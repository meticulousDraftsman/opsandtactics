    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Magical materials are materials that act counter to standard material behavior, and have properties that are beneficial and desired. When upgrading or building a weapon out of a magical material, the contact, the handle, or both, may be built out of the material, so long as the contact or handle is made or can be made from a comparable material. The price increase is per contact, or handle; making a weapon out of both doubles this cost. Nonballistic ammunition can also be made of these materials, the cost of this being for one full set of what is sold (for example, Arrows are sold in sets of 20 arrows). The cost is for a single area. When upgrading materials on a weapon, no upgrade points are used and the weapon retains itâ€™s full prior upgrades that were on it previously.</span></p><p>The WP cost and weight listed in the item's statistics is the cost and weight for a Medium sized ingot of the material.<br style=\" font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; \"></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Mithril is a shiny metal, often mistaken for silver or nickel at first glance. It is lighter than steel but just as strong. Any melee weapon with a metal contact can have a contact made of Mithril. Any weapon made from Mithril is considered one size smaller for the purpose of Combat Point Cost. Any weapon made of Mithril reduces it weight by 45% per area, and can use the Combat Point for attacking as if it were one size smaller. When enchanting Mithril, all enchantment effects with numerical values are doubled. Weapons made with Mithril have a 600% cost increase per area.</span> <br style=\" font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; \"></p>"
