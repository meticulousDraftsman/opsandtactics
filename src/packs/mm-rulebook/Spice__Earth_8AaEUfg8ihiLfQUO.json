    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Spice is a chemical a concoction of aromatics that have been desiccated and sealed in an airtight airtight glass bottle, that enhance psionic powers. It has a multitude of tradenames, but all try to incorporate the name spice in them, for identification by interested parties. Spice is taken by uncapping the bottle, and inhaling in the fumes given off by the aromatics. Each bottle contains enough spice for 1 dose. The effects of the spice are determined by the element of spice, as listed below</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Earth Spice has a vibrant green color to it, with stripes of tan that carve jagged lines throughout it. Earth Spice enhances Psychometabolism. While under the effects of Earth Spice, the ranges for Teleportation, Psyrunning, and Psisense are tripled, but every time the character uses one of these powers, they take 1d3 HP of damage. While under the effects of Earth Spice, the characterâ€™s eyes glow green.</span> <br style=\" font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; \"></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Roboto, sans-serif\">The effects of spice last for 3 hours. After the effect wears off, the character is considered Inebriated for 1 hour. If a character takes another dose of spice while under the effects of spice, they receive the new effects and the duration time resets back to 3 hours, they lose the abilities of the old effects, and are immediately considered Inebriated for 1 hour.</span><br style=\" font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; \"></p>"
