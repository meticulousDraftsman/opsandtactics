    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">A glowing blue lotion-like substance that is rubbed directly into the skin to cause a euphoric feeling and a mental and physical fortification.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\"><br>A character may apply one dose of Moonbeam to their skin, granting them a +4 bonus to Will and Fortitude Saving Throws for 1d4 hours. The character may also apply more, which will add one hour to the duration and a +1 bonus to both Saving Throws. When the effect wears off, the character makes a Will Saving Throw [TN10] and a Fortitude Saving Throw [TN10], that has an increase of the TN by 1 for every previous application within 3 weeks of the last use, and by 2 for every previous application while the character was still under the effects of the drug. If a character fails the Will Saving Throw, they take temporary WIS damage equal to the bonus they received. If the character fails the Fortitude Saving Throw, they take temporary CON damage equal to the bonus received. The character can rest for 4 hours per point of damage taken to recuperate or receive long term care from a character who must make a Treat Injury check on them to reduce the time needed to rest by half. Moonbeam is packaged in a tube or small jar that holds enough for 10 doses</span> <br style=\" font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; \"></p>"
