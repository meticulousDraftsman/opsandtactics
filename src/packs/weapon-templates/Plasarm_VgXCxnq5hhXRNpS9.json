    "description": "<h3>Plasma Arms</h3><p>Plasarms with the semi-automatic firing mode can perform potshot attacks, and double-tap attacks. When performing a double tap attack, Plasarms have a —3 attack penalty.</p><h3>Chargeshot</h3><p>A chargeshot is when a plasarm’s emitter charges its shot by keeping its containment field up before it releases its shot, allowing the plasma to build before firing. If the plasarm or lasarm has a charge emitter, it may be used to perform a chargeshot attack. The character targets a specific creature and makes an attack roll. If the attack is successful, the character gains extra damage dice based on the amount of time the character charged the plasarm. Charging the plasarm costs 2 Combat Points per charge level, and the character gains 1 additional damage die per charge level. The dice are always the same type as used in the original damage. Using this attack uses 1 unit of Heat plus 1 unit of Heat per charge level and can only be done if the weapon has enough Heat to support the attack. If the character does not have enough Heat, the plasarm will perform the attack to the best of its ability and immediately shut down. If a character attempts to use more than 50% of a plasarm’s total Heat for a single charged attack, the plasarm becomes damaged immediately, does not fire, and immediately requires electrical repairs (Complex, TN25) in order to function once again.</p><h3>Waveshot</h3><p>A waveshot is when a plasarm’s emitter fires one long stream of plasma at a specific area. If a plasarm has a wave emitter, it may be used to perform a waveshot attack. Waveshot affects an area, and everything in it, not a specific creature. The character first chooses the length of their waveshot. The character then selects a direction they wish to fire. This length is restricted to two range increments. When they fire, the waveshot fills a 5’ wide area in the direction they selected, with the length of the waveshot being the chosen length. There is no attack roll. Every creature within the affected area must make a Reflex Saving Throw [TN9]. If they succeed, they take half of the weapon’s damage. A waveshot uses 3 units of Heat per 5’ in length the waveshot fires, and can only be done if the weapon has enough Heat to support the attack. If the character does not have enough Heat, the plasarm will perform the attack to the best of its ability and immediately shut down.</p><h3>Bounceshot</h3><p>A bounceshot is using the surrounding area to bounce a shot off a wall, tree, structure, or other solid structure to shoot around corners, or hit enemies that would be otherwise out of reach. If a plasarm has a bounce emitter, it may be used to bounceshot. A character targets a square with a wall, a structure, or any non organic Huge or larger object with at least 2 points of HP, and fires. The character then guides the shot as if they were standing in that targeted square, facing the same direction the shot originally came from, and and targets a single creature and makes an attack roll with a −6 penalty, using that new location, using any bonus or penalties that may be removed or added due to the new location. If the attack is successful, the character may roll the standard damage. A bounceshot uses 4 units of Heat, and can only be done if the weapon has enough Heat to support the attack. Bounceshot can not perform called shot attacks.</p><h3>Gridshot</h3><p>A gridshot is a burst of loosely controlled plasma or a grid of lasers, fired at a specific area. If a plasarm or lasarm has a grid emitter, it may be used to perform a gridshot attack. Gridshot attacks affects an area and everyone in it, not a specific creature. The character targets a 10’-by-10’ area and makes an attack roll with a −6 penalty; the targeted area has an effective DEF of 10. If the attack succeeds, every creature within the affected area must make a Reflex Saving Throw [TN18]. If they succeed, they take half of the weapon’s damage. A gridshot uses 8 units of Heat, and can only be done if the weapon has enough Heat to support the attack. Gridshot can not perform called shot attacks.</p><h3>Pulseshot</h3><p>A pulseshot is burst of rapid plasma bolts fired at a specific target. If a plasarm or lasarm has a pulse emitter, it may be used to perform a pulseshot attack. The character targets a specific creature and makes an attack roll with a −6 penalty. If the attack succeeds, the character may roll their damage with 2 extra damage dice plus +1 damage per 10 kW rating the plasma has. The dice are always the same type as used in the original damage. A pulseshot uses 5 units of Heat, and can only be done if the weapon has enough Heat to support the attack. Pulseshot can not perform called shot attacks.</p>",
