Holsters allow a character to draw a firearm for 3 Combat Points. Holsters are generally available for all Medium or smaller firearms. A character can not have more than 5 belt devices on their belt at one time, including holsters, holders, caddys, and sheaths</span>.</p><p></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">This holster is worn on the thigh, with a strap attaching it to the belt, or on the hip, attached to a belt. It also comes with a tactical caddy, which can be purchased in any combination of two, to hold handgun magazines, speedloaders, taser cartridges, standard flashlights, three shotgun shells, six loose cased rounds, or pairs of handcuffs. A tactical caddy can be purchased to hold a single handgun magazine and a pair of handcuffs, for example. A tactical caddy can also be purchased to hold a single PDW or rifle magazine that holds 20 rounds or less, or a single shotgun magazine that holds 5 rounds or less. Using a tactical caddy eliminates the need to spend CP to reach into a pocket or bag to retrieve the holstered items. A tactical caddy can also be purchased by itself for 1 WP</span> <br style=\" font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; \"><br style=\" font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; \"></p>"
