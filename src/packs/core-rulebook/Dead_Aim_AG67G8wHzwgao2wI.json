This grants the character a +2 circumstance bonus on their next attack roll. The attack must be a single shot attack. Any other attack besides a single shot does not gain the bonuses for this attack, and the character loses the benefit of aiming. If the character takes damage or is effected by a status effect before they attack, the character loses the benefit of aiming. All movement costs are doubled if the character uses the benefits of this feat, until they either forgo the bonus to attack, or perform any attack. The effect does not stack between rounds.</span> <br style=\" font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; \"></p>",
