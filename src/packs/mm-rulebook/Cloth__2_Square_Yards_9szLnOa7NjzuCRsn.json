    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Cloth span the various types of surfaces used for paintings, but can also include makeshift canvases, such as torn sheets, clothing, or any piece of cloth with enough writing space to scribe a spell. Generally, cotton, linen or hemp cloth is used when scribing, but spells can also be scribed on heavier cloth such as denim. Cloth requires brushes instead of pens, with ink being the primary medium to use. Spell written on cloth can be cast a total of 4 times before the cloth fibers break down and become unusable. They are sold in 2 yard bolts. The two yard of cloth can be cut into 24 small pieces or 4 medium pieces, as the purchaser requires. Small pieces of cloth can be put into spell books. Small pieces of cloth can accommodate one spell, Medium sized pieces of cloth can accommodate 6 spells, and Large pieces of cloth can accommodate 12 spells. Multiple spells on cloth, when cast, only destroy that part of the cloth; the rest of the cloth stays intact. Cloth is purchased in 2 yard rolls</span>.<br style=\" font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; orphans: 2; text-align: -webkit-auto; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-size-adjust: auto; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; \"></p>"
