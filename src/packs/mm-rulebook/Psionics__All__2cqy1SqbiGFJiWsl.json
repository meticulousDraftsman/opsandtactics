Unlike mages, Psions may use their abilities as long as they are conscious, and can afford the Combat Point cost to use their abilities, but they must meditate for 8 hours and prepare their mind for use. After this initial meditation, it only takes 1 hour a day to maintain this meditation. If this meditation is not maintained, then a Psion must spend 8 hours meditating and gaining focus over again. Psionics requires Mental Limit to use, and costs <span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size:10pt;\"><strong>(2Ã—Character Level)+25</strong></span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">. Psions unable to provide this Mental Limit cost can not use their powers. When a Psion would like to clear their mind and their Mental Limit, they may meditate for 1 hour to do as such, freeing their mind of the Mental Limit cost.<br></span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Psions may use their powers at will, with no need to prepare recipes like Invokers, or spells like Mages. Psionic Points are PP, and a character can use a power with enhancements up to the Skill modifier in that particular power that they have.</span> </p>"
