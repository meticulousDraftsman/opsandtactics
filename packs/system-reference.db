To replace the value in these kinds of inputs, begin your entry with =. These inputs will automatically highlight their content when selected to help enter these delta inputs.</p><h3>Clickable Elements</h3><p>Parts of the sheet that 'do something' when clicked will highlight when moused over and generally be bold.</p><h3>Embedded Items</h3><p>Anywhere you can click to edit an item, you can right-click for additional options. You can create a duplicate of the item inside the actor, or copy it to the world sidebar itself. This is useful when setting up multiple similar items or ones that can be used by multiple characters.</p><h3>Checks, Effects, and Resource Consumption</h3><p>Available actions on the character sheet are often divided between a 'check' and an 'effect' roll. If the action consumes resources, the check will be what actually consumes them. To avoid consuming resources, hold <code>alt</code> when clicking on the check roll. To ignore any warnings about insufficient resources and potentially end up with negative numbers, hold <code>ctrl</code> when clicking on the check roll. To skip the dialog for adding/modifying situational modifiers, hold <code>shift</code> when clicking on the check roll.</p><h1>Sheet Header</h1><h3>Name and Token Image</h3><p>Newly-created actors will have a randomly-assigned icon for their image. So long as the token image is one of the random possibilities, updating it will update the prototype token image just like the default behavior in other systems.</p><h3>Health</h3><p>XHP and CHP are both Delta Inputs. They can also be altered by applying damage to them on the Defense tab. The Temp field is for reference and not used in calculations.</p><h3>Combat Points</h3><p>CP is a Delta Input. It can also be altered by the resource consumption of actions. The Max field is for reference and not used in calculations. The Temp field is used to determine how many Combat Points past zero can be spent without warning. Loss is derived from active Armor and can be deducted from the current value.</p><h3>Defense</h3><p>Defense, Flat-Footed Defense, and Touch Defense are all derived from other properties and shown here for easy reference.</p><h1>Character</h1><h3>Ability Scores</h3><p>The ability modifier for the six core abilities is calculated and displayed on the right. For the two ability scores with split modifiers, Strength and Dexterity, inputting the modifier for the Focus and Marksmanship will allocate the rest of the ability's modifier to Power and Agility, respectively. The labels are all rollable as generic ability checks.</p><h3>Saving Throws</h3><p>By expanding each display, you can edit the multiplier applied to each base save or input an arbitrary modifier. The main labels themselves are rollable.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p>Total spent skill points are displayed alongside total gained skill points. Each Skill item the character has is displayed can be edited, reordered, and its skill check rolled.</p><h1>Traits</h1><h3>Formulae</h3><p>Here is where the calculations are defined for maximum CHP, XHP, ML, and basic Encumbrance. These are usually modified by active effects from Feature items, but they can be manually adjusted as well.</p><h3>Modifiers</h3><p>Here is where the total modifiers for BAB, Initiative, and Recoil Reduction are displayed alongside the corresponding inputs for miscellaneous modifiers. The dropdown for Initiative Wagering is also present here, and automatically applies to initiative and attack.</p><h3>Character Option Points</h3><p>Here is where the player applies the effects from their spent C.O.P.s during character creation and leveling up. Each input field is for the total effect of any spent points, not for the points themselves.</p><h3>Traits and Feats</h3><p>Each Feature item the character has is displayed with its summary for reference and can be edited or reordered.</p><h1>Offense</h1><h3>Weapons, Objects, and Magic</h3><p>All display mostly the same information for the three different item types All Weapons are displayed, and any Objects or Magics with attack-type actions are also shown. Within each category the items can be edited, reordered, or minimized.</p><p>Critical threat range is displayed if applicable. Error range is displayed for weapons, and the percentile chance for jamming potential can be rolled. Ammunition or other resource expenditure is displayed and potentially editable.</p><p>To the right each action displays its check, effect (if applicable), and any resources consumed by the check.</p><h1>Defense</h1><h3>Defense Modifiers</h3><p>The various factors that contribute to defense are editable here. Dodge and equipment are shown as totals alongside their miscellaneous inputs since they rely on other properties.</p><h3>Defense Impacts</h3><p>The total penalties incurred by every active piece of Armor present on the character. Max Agility automatically applies to the ability modifier, Armor Penalty is referenced by skills marked as sensitive to it, and CP Loss is available to deduct in the header.</p><h3>Extremity Damage</h3><p>A set of simple clickable toggles to mark whether a given limb is wounded or not. Purely for reference.</p><h3>Damage and Hit Points</h3><p>The number of bleed dice can be input and then rolled, applying it to the incoming damage. Incoming Damage itself is a Delta Input, and by right clicking a roll message with a token selected you can add its value to the incoming damage as well. The notes field is for reference.</p><h3>Magical Protection, Plasma Shielding, Armor Plates, Worn Armor, Other Protection, and Inactive Protection</h3><p>Each Armor item the character has is displayed here in its relevant category and can be edited or reordered. Their current Armor Points or Soak can also be edited, and for armors with different kinds of protection the currently-applicable Damage Reduction can be selected.</p><h3>Applying Damage</h3><p>The icons accompanying XHP, CHP, and each Armor will take the incoming damage amount and apply it to the associated value depending on its type.</p><ul><li><p>XHP can't be negative, but CHP can.</p></li><li><p>Any Armor without a defined Armor Point/Soak maximum is treated as simple Damage Reduction, reducing the incoming damage.</p></li><li><p>Plasma Shielding applies its DR to the incoming damage first, potentially diffusing it entirely before starting to lose Soak.</p></li><li><p>All other Armors with defined pools of Armor Points spend their AP to reduce the incoming damage using their DR.</p></li><li><p>A dialog may pop up asking if the attacker is doing something special that would impact the damage application. Hold <code>shift</code> when clicking the icon to skip these.</p></li></ul><p>Each 'step' of applying the same chunk of damage will output its result to a chat message. Until the incoming damage is reduced entirely or another chat message interrupts, the same message is updated with each step.</p><h1>Utility</h1><h3>Mental Limit</h3><p>The various factors that contribute to Mental Limit usage and capacity are displayed here. Miscellaneous costs can come from active effects or the provided input. Whether a character is psionically focused or memorizing a set of incantation recipes can be toggled. Temporary ML from drugs or other sources can be input. ML spent by invoking can be manually edited but will usually be altered by actions that spend it, and the icon will refund the amount that an invoker naturally regains every round. Mental limit from objects is derived from all objects with a magic resource that has an ML cost and nonzero uses remaining.</p><h3>Resources</h3><p>Items with available resources will be listed here for easy reference and editing.</p><ul><li><p>Quantity is only available or even displayed if marked as available.</p></li><li><p>Consumable resources must be marked available for use.</p></li><li><p>Coolant resources are always available for selection, but can be marked as cool or hot.</p></li><li><p>Magic resources are always available for selection, and can optionally incur a ML cost when they have nonzero uses.</p></li><li><p>Generic resources are for reference only.</p></li></ul><h3>Character</h3><p>A list of general actions a character can perform along with their Combat Point costs and an arbitrary multiplier. Clicking the icon will deduct the total CP cost from the character.</p><h3>Objects</h3><p>Objects with utility actions will be listed here in much the same fashion as on the Offense tab.</p><h3>Magic</h3><p>All Magic items will be listed here in much the same fashion as on the Offense tab.</p><h1>Gear</h1><h3>Money</h3><p>Three fields are included for tracking wealth points if a single number isn't enough. All three are Delta Inputs, and the labels are simply suggestions. The notes are for reference. The income formula can be rolled by clicking the accompanying icon.</p><h3>Encumbrance</h3><p>Displays the light, medium, and heavy load capacity based on the formulae and any other effects.</p><h3>Capital</h3><p>Displays how much Personal Capital the character would have based on their Charisma score and Level, as well as inputs for any External Capital and how much each of those are tied up in hard assets.</p><h3>Loose Items, Worn Items, Carried Items, and Stored Items</h3><p>Each organizational category tallies the total weight of objects inside it. Items are displayed with their icons and any items that are nested within them, and can be edited or reordered.</p><h1>Biography</h1><p>Race and Size are often set by Active Effect but can be manually set. Everything except Level is purely for reference; Level is used to calculate the character's Base Attack Bonus.</p><h1>Active Effects</h1><h3>Temporary Effects, Passive Effects, and Inactive Effects</h3><p>Displays Every Active Effect present on the Character, as well as where it comes from. Each can be toggled active or inactive, edited, or deleted</p><h3>Unfiltered Item List</h3><p>Provided as a failsafe in case a misbehaving item isn't showing up anywhere else or can't be opened to delete it.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":0,"name":"Item Types","type":"text","_id":"tfnsjIc7mbPxH1j4","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>Common Concepts</h1><p>When owned by a character, a trash icon will be present in the item's own sheet in order to delete it.</p><h3>Physical Objects</h3><p>Weapons, Objects, and some Armors are 'physical objects' with a common set of properties. They have a Quantity, Size, Weight, Cost, Quality, License, Container, and Note. Quantity can potentially be uses as a resource, and it also affects the total displayed weight when owned by a character. Weight can be toggled between pounds and tons by clicking the icon. Cost can be toggled between wealth points and capital by clicking the icon. Container determines where the item is sorted on the character's Gear tab, either inside one of the main categories or 'inside' another item.</p><p>Physical Objects also have Resources. Each icon adds a resource of the corresponding type, besides Quantity which is always present.</p><ul><li><p>Quantity will be spent directly, and can be made available.</p></li><li><p>Consumable resources can have a value and maximum, and can be made available.</p></li><li><p>Coolant resources have a value and a hot/cool state, are always available.</p></li><li><p>Magic resources can have a value and maximum as well as a constant Mental Limit cost when their value is nonzero, and are always available.</p></li><li><p>Generic resources can be non-numeric and are for reference only.</p></li></ul><h1>Weapon</h1><h3>Weapon Statistics</h3><p>Weapon Range is just for reference. Critical Range and Error Range % are used to display potential critical strikes and jams when rolling attack checks.</p><ul><li><p>An Internal magazine defines its current and maximum ammo on its own. The load/unload icon allows you to transfer ammo to or from other available resources.</p></li><li><p>An External magazine then selects an available Quantity or Consumable resource to use as ammo, as well as any additional bullets in the chamber. Clicking the text will transfer a single round from the current magazine into the chamber. The weapon has access to its own Quantity and Consumable resources even if they haven't been made available.</p></li><li><p>A Fusion magazine then elects a Coolant resource to accept its spent heat, as well as defining the weapon's own Heat Capacity.</p></li><li><p>And Ammo n/A allows for infinite use ignoring any ammo consumption.</p></li></ul><h3>Weapon Modifiers</h3><p>'Weapon Mod' is a catch-all term for things that can effect the to-hit, damage, recoil, or combat point cost of a weapon's attack. They might be feats, weapon upgrades and attachments, ammunition, or even magical enchantments. They're made to be easy to copy from the source, simple to edit within a given weapon, and applicable selectively to each aspect of each attack in the weapon. A weapon attachment that only gives an attack bonus to single-shot attacks can be toggled for only those attacks, a cartridge's recoil penalty can be marked only for multi-shot attacks where it applies, and so on and so forth.</p><p>New weapon mods can be made from scratch, or a source of weapon mods can be selected followed by an individual mod from that source to copy it. Each weapon mod within the item is then listed with its name, to-hit impact, damage impact, recoil impact, and CP impact along with its description for reference.</p><h3>Attacks</h3><p>Here every attack in the weapon is listed.</p><ul><li><p>The Active checkbox determines whether the attack is displayed on the character sheet. The Details icon collapses the attack to make working with long attack lists easier. Ammo determines how much is consumed from whatever source the weapon is using.</p></li><li><p>Ranged or Melee Attack determines what situational modifiers apply to it. A Message simply outputs text rather than rolling anything, and Resources Only spends the ammo and CP without any further indication.</p></li><li><p>To-Hit is clickable, prompting a dialog for adding one of the weapon's weapon mods. The From Attack input is for any modifiers inherent to the attack itself, and the ability score dropdown for what ability modifier applies to the attack's accuracy. Below these the applied weapon mods are listed.</p></li><li><p>Recoil is clickable, again prompting a dialog for weapon mods alongside an input for recoil inherent to the attack. If recoil is left completely empty and blank, it will not be included in the overall to-hit calculation.</p></li><li><p>CP is clickable, again prompting a dialog for weapon mods alongside an input for combat point cost inherent to the attack.</p></li><li><p>Damage is clickable, again prompting a dialog for weapon mods alongside an input for damage inherent to the attack, an ability modifier dropdown and a multiplier for that ability score modifier.</p></li><li><p>Flavor text inputs are displayed for the attack check roll/message and damage roll.</p></li></ul><h1>Armor</h1><h3>Armor Statistics</h3><ul><li><p>Layer determines which category the armor is sorted into on the character sheet, as well as how it responds to applied damage.</p></li><li><p>Armor Points/Shield Soak determines the 'health' of the armor's protection. Leave blank for flat damage reduction.</p></li><li><p>The Physical checkbox determines whether the armor is a physical object that should be shown with the rest of the character's gear, or something like a plasma shield or magical effect.</p></li><li><p>The Active checkbox determines whether the armor's defense impacts should be applied to the character.</p></li><li><p>Defense Bonus, Max Agility, Armor Penalty, and CP Loss all contribute to the character's defense impacts if the armor is active. Note: A max agility of 0 is <em>not</em> the same as a max agility of none!</p></li></ul><h3>Protection</h3><p>An editable list of what damage types the armor protects against and how much damage reduction it applies to each.</p><h1>Skill</h1><h3>Total Modifier</h3><p>An Unfocused skill costs two skill points for every rank. Focused and Double-Focused skill costs one skill point for each rank, and Double-Focused skills receive a +1 to their Occupation bonus. The Ability dropdown selects which ability score applies to the skill, Ranks is how many skill ranks the character has in the skill, and the Armor Penalty checkbox determines whether the total modifier should be impacted by the character's Armor Penalty.</p><h3>Equipment, Miscellaneous, Occupational, and Synergy Modifiers</h3><p>Each category is a list of skill impacts with a name, modifier, and whether the modifier is active or not. This can be useful for a character with different sets of tools; they can toggle whether to apply the bonus from their handheld first aid kit or the surgery tools they have back at home base, for example.</p><h1>Object</h1><h3>Object Actions</h3><p>Objects can have a variety of action types defined, both for attack and utility. Like weapons they can have a critical threat range. Unlike weapons, their choices for action resources are simplified.</p><ul><li><p>Unlimited Uses is exactly what it sounds like</p></li><li><p>Internal Uses selects the Quantity or a Consumable resource from itself, ignoring whether or not they've been marked as available.</p></li><li><p>External Uses selects an available Quantity or Consumable resource from other objects owned by the character, ignoring its own.</p></li></ul><p>Object Actions are similar to weapon attacks but lack weapon mods or recoil, and their modifiers are almost all manually input.</p><ul><li><p>The Active checkbox determines whether the attack is displayed on the character sheet. CP cost is a manual input, and Cost determines how much is consumed from whatever source the object is using.</p></li><li><p>The check types labeled (Attack) behave the same as on weapons, and will make the action display on the Offense tab. The other check types will display the action on the Utility tab.</p></li><li><p>Skill Checks select a Skill item on the character to roll when the check is performed.</p></li><li><p>Generic Checks are exactly that, a plain 3d6 roll plus the action modifier and ability modifier.</p></li><li><p>Other Rolls just roll what's input with no preceding 3d6.</p></li><li><p>The (Utility) versions of Message and Resources work the same as for attacks.</p></li></ul><h1>Feature</h1><p>Features are mainly vehicles for reference text and potentially Active Effects that passively alter the character. Things like overriding the racial CHP formula, or the CHP and XHP bonuses from Toughness.</p><h1>Magic</h1><p>Magic Properties</p><p>Like Objects, Magics can have a variety of action types defined and have their own choices for resource expenditure.</p><ul><li><p>Unlimited Use is, again, exactly what it sounds like</p></li><li><p>External Charges selects a Magic resource from another object the character owns, and deducts its cost from it.</p></li><li><p>Mental Limit on Use adds its cost to the character's Mental Limit Spent Invoking when used.</p></li></ul><p>Its actions are identical to Object actions in every way except for the lack of Skill Checks as an action type. Attack type actions are displayed on the Offense tab, everything else is displayed on the Utility Tab.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.LuRbvO18D1wxIuRc"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"opsandtactics","systemVersion":"0.0.13","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1681238179237,"modifiedTime":1697872808312,"lastModifiedBy":"qUf9EhhQBxZF46Rx"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"qUf9EhhQBxZF46Rx":3},"_id":"ZBCG2QUPG3qFFtyL"}

To replace the value in these kinds of inputs, begin your entry with =. These inputs will automatically highlight their content when selected to help enter these delta inputs.</p><h3>Clickable Elements</h3><p>Parts of the sheet that 'do something' when clicked will highlight when moused over and generally be bold.</p><h3>Embedded Items</h3><p>Anywhere you can click to edit an item, you can right-click for additional options. You can create a duplicate of the item inside the actor, or copy it to the world sidebar itself. This is useful when setting up multiple similar items or ones that can be used by multiple characters.</p><h3>Checks, Effects, and Resource Consumption</h3><p>Available actions on the character sheet are often divided between a 'check' and an 'effect' roll. If the action consumes resources, the check will be what actually consumes them. To avoid consuming resources, hold <code>alt</code> when clicking on the check roll. To ignore any warnings about insufficient resources and potentially end up with negative numbers, hold <code>ctrl</code> when clicking on the check roll. To skip the dialog for adding/modifying situational modifiers, hold <code>shift</code> when clicking on the check roll.</p><h1>Sheet Header</h1><h3>Name and Token Image</h3><p>Newly-created actors will have a randomly-assigned icon for their image. So long as the token image is one of the random possibilities, updating it will update the prototype token image just like the default behavior in other systems.</p><h3>Health</h3><p>XHP and CHP are both Delta Inputs. They can also be altered by applying damage to them on the Defense tab. The Temp field is for reference and not used in calculations.</p><h3>Combat Points</h3><p>CP is a Delta Input. It can also be altered by the resource consumption of actions. The Max field is for reference and not used in calculations. The Temp field is used to determine how many Combat Points past zero can be spent without warning. Loss is derived from active Armor and can be deducted from the current value.</p><h3>Defense</h3><p>Defense, Flat-Footed Defense, and Touch Defense are all derived from other properties and shown here for easy reference.</p><h1>Character</h1><h3>Ability Scores</h3><p>The ability modifier for the six core abilities is calculated and displayed on the right. For the two ability scores with split modifiers, Strength and Dexterity, inputting the modifier for the Focus and Marksmanship will allocate the rest of the ability's modifier to Power and Agility, respectively. The labels are all rollable as generic ability checks.</p><h3>Saving Throws</h3><p>By expanding each display, you can edit the multiplier applied to each base save or input an arbitrary modifier. The main labels themselves are rollable.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p>Total spent skill points are displayed alongside total gained skill points. Each Skill item the character has is displayed can be edited, reordered, and its skill check rolled.</p><h1>Traits</h1><h3>Formulae</h3><p>Here is where the calculations are defined for maximum CHP, XHP, ML, and basic Encumbrance. These are usually modified by active effects from Feature items, but they can be manually adjusted as well.</p><h3>Modifiers</h3><p>Here is where the total modifiers for BAB, Initiative, and Recoil Reduction are displayed alongside the corresponding inputs for miscellaneous modifiers. The dropdown for Initiative Wagering is also present here, and automatically applies to initiative and attack.</p><h3>Character Option Points</h3><p>Here is where the player applies the effects from their spent C.O.P.s during character creation and leveling up. Each input field is for the total effect of any spent points, not for the points themselves.</p><h3>Traits and Feats</h3><p>Each Feature item the character has is displayed with its summary for reference and can be edited or reordered.</p><h1>Offense</h1><h3>Weapons, Objects, and Magic</h3><p>All display mostly the same information for the three different item types All Weapons are displayed, and any Objects or Magics with attack-type actions are also shown. Within each category the items can be edited, reordered, or minimized.</p><p>Critical threat range is displayed if applicable. Error range is displayed for weapons, and the percentile chance for jamming potential can be rolled. Ammunition or other resource expenditure is displayed and potentially editable.</p><p>To the right each action displays its check, effect (if applicable), and any resources consumed by the check.</p><h1>Defense</h1><h3>Defense Modifiers</h3><p>The various factors that contribute to defense are editable here. Dodge, Equipment, and Miscellaneous are shown as totals alongside their miscellaneous inputs since they rely on other properties and can be targeted by active effects.</p><h3>Defense Impacts</h3><p>The total penalties incurred by every active piece of Armor present on the character. Max Agility automatically applies to the ability modifier, Armor Penalty is referenced by skills marked as sensitive to it, and CP Loss is available to deduct in the header.</p><h3>Extremity Damage</h3><p>A set of simple clickable toggles to mark whether a given limb is wounded or not. Purely for reference.</p><h3>Damage and Hit Points</h3><p>The number of bleed dice can be input and then rolled, applying it to the incoming damage. Incoming Damage itself is a Delta Input, and by right clicking a roll message with a token selected you can add its value to the incoming damage as well. The notes field is for reference.</p><h3>Magical Protection, Plasma Shielding, Armor Plates, Worn Armor, Other Protection, and Inactive Protection</h3><p>Each Armor item the character has is displayed here in its relevant category and can be edited or reordered.

They might be feats, weapon upgrades and attachments, ammunition, or even magical enchantments. They're made to be easy to copy from the source, simple to edit within a given weapon, and applicable selectively to each aspect of each attack in the weapon. A weapon attachment that only gives an attack bonus to single-shot attacks can be toggled for only those attacks, a cartridge's recoil penalty can be marked only for multi-shot attacks where it applies, and so on and so forth.</p><p>New weapon mods can be made from scratch, or a source of weapon mods can be selected followed by an individual mod from that source to copy it. Each weapon mod within the item is then listed with its name, to-hit impact, damage impact, recoil impact, and CP impact along with its description for reference.</p><h3>Attacks</h3><p>Here every attack in the weapon is listed.</p><ul><li><p>The Active checkbox determines whether the attack is displayed on the character sheet. The Details icon collapses the attack to make working with long attack lists easier. Ammo determines how much is consumed from whatever source the weapon is using.</p></li><li><p>Ranged or Melee Attack determines what situational modifiers apply to it. A Message simply outputs text rather than rolling anything, and Resources Only spends the ammo and CP without any further indication.</p></li><li><p>To-Hit is clickable, prompting a dialog for adding one of the weapon's weapon mods. The From Attack input is for any modifiers inherent to the attack itself, and the ability score dropdown for what ability modifier applies to the attack's accuracy. Below these the applied weapon mods are listed.</p></li><li><p>Recoil is clickable, again prompting a dialog for weapon mods alongside an input for recoil inherent to the attack. If recoil is left completely empty and blank, it will not be included in the overall to-hit calculation.</p></li><li><p>CP is clickable, again prompting a dialog for weapon mods alongside an input for combat point cost inherent to the attack.</p></li><li><p>Damage is clickable, again prompting a dialog for weapon mods alongside an input for damage inherent to the attack, an ability modifier dropdown and a multiplier for that ability score modifier.</p></li><li><p>Flavor text inputs are displayed for the attack check roll/message and damage roll.</p></li></ul><h1>Armor</h1><h3>Armor Statistics</h3><ul><li><p>Layer determines which category the armor is sorted into on the character sheet, as well as how it responds to applied damage.</p></li><li><p>Armor Points/Shield Soak determines the 'health' of the armor's protection. Leave blank for flat damage reduction.</p></li><li><p>The Physical checkbox determines whether the armor is a physical object that should be shown with the rest of the character's gear, or something like a plasma shield or magical effect.</p></li><li><p>The Active checkbox determines whether the armor's defense impacts should be applied to the character.</p></li><li><p>Defense Bonus, Max Agility, Armor Penalty, and CP Loss all contribute to the character's defense impacts if the armor is active. Note: A max agility of 0 is <em>not</em> the same as a max agility of none!</p></li></ul><h3>Protection</h3><p>An editable list of what damage types the armor protects against and how much damage reduction it applies to each.</p><h1>Skill</h1><h3>Total Modifier</h3><p>An Unfocused skill costs two skill points for every rank. Focused and Double-Focused skill costs one skill point for each rank, and Double-Focused skills receive a +1 to their Occupation bonus. The Ability dropdown selects which ability score applies to the skill, Ranks is how many skill ranks the character has in the skill, and the Armor Penalty checkbox determines whether the total modifier should be impacted by the character's Armor Penalty.</p><h3>Equipment, Miscellaneous, Occupational, and Synergy Modifiers</h3><p>Each category is a list of skill impacts with a name, modifier, and whether the modifier is active or not. This can be useful for a character with different sets of tools; they can toggle whether to apply the bonus from their handheld first aid kit or the surgery tools they have back at home base, for example.</p><h1>Object</h1><h3>Object Actions</h3><p>Objects can have a variety of action types defined, both for attack and utility. Like weapons they can have a critical threat range. Unlike weapons, their choices for action resources are simplified.</p><ul><li><p>Unlimited Uses is exactly what it sounds like</p></li><li><p>Internal Uses selects the Quantity or a Consumable resource from itself, ignoring whether or not they've been marked as available.</p></li><li><p>External Uses selects an available Quantity or Consumable resource from other objects owned by the character, ignoring its own.</p></li></ul><p>Object Actions are similar to weapon attacks but lack weapon mods or recoil, and their modifiers are almost all manually input.</p><ul><li><p>The Active checkbox determines whether the attack is displayed on the character sheet. CP cost is a manual input, and Cost determines how much is consumed from whatever source the object is using.</p></li><li><p>The check types labeled (Attack) behave the same as on weapons, and will make the action display on the Offense tab. The other check types will display the action on the Utility tab.</p></li><li><p>Skill Checks select a Skill item on the character to roll when the check is performed.</p></li><li><p>Generic Checks are exactly that, a plain 3d6 roll plus the action modifier and ability modifier.</p></li><li><p>Other Rolls just roll what's input with no preceding 3d6.</p></li><li><p>The (Utility) versions of Message and Resources work the same as for attacks.</p></li></ul><h1>Feature</h1><p>Features are mainly vehicles for reference text and potentially Active Effects that passively alter the character. Things like overriding the racial CHP formula, or the CHP and XHP bonuses from Toughness.</p><h1>Magic</h1><p>Magic Properties</p><p>Like Objects, Magics can have a variety of action types defined and have their own choices for resource expenditure.</p><ul><li><p>Unlimited Use is, again, exactly what it sounds like</p></li><li><p>External Charges selects a Magic resource from another object the character owns, and deducts its cost from it.</p></li><li><p>Mental Limit on Use adds its cost to the character's Mental Limit Spent Invoking when used.</p></li></ul><p>Its actions are identical to Object actions in every way except for the lack of Skill Checks as an action type. Attack type actions are displayed on the Offense tab, everything else is displayed on the Utility Tab.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.LuRbvO18D1wxIuRc"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"opsandtactics","systemVersion":"0.0.13","coreVersion":"10.303","createdTime":1681238179237,"modifiedTime":1698023715793,"lastModifiedBy":"qUf9EhhQBxZF46Rx"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"qUf9EhhQBxZF46Rx":3},"_id":"ZBCG2QUPG3qFFtyL"}

You can create a duplicate of the item inside the actor, or copy it to the world sidebar itself. This is useful when setting up multiple similar items or ones that can be used by multiple characters.</p><h3>Checks, Effects, and Resource Consumption</h3><p>Available actions on the character sheet are often divided between a 'check' and an 'effect' roll. If the action consumes resources, the check will be what actually consumes them. To avoid consuming resources, hold <code>alt</code> when clicking on the check roll. To ignore any warnings about insufficient resources and potentially end up with negative numbers, hold <code>ctrl</code> when clicking on the check roll.

They can also be altered by applying damage to them on the Defense tab. The Temp field is for reference and not used in calculations.</p><h3>Combat Points</h3><p>CP is a Delta Input. It can also be altered by the resource consumption of actions. The Max field is for reference and not used in calculations. The Temp field is used to determine how many Combat Points past zero can be spent without warning. Loss is derived from active Armor and can be deducted from the current value.</p><h3>Defense</h3><p>Defense, Flat-Footed Defense, and Touch Defense are all derived from other properties and shown here for easy reference.</p><h1>Character</h1><h3>Ability Scores</h3><p>The ability modifier for the six core abilities is calculated and displayed on the right. For the two ability scores with split modifiers, Strength and Dexterity, inputting the modifier for the Focus and Marksmanship will allocate the rest of the ability's modifier to Power and Agility, respectively. The labels are all rollable as generic ability checks.</p><h3>Saving Throws</h3><p>By expanding each display, you can edit the multiplier applied to each base save or input an arbitrary modifier. The main labels themselves are rollable.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p>Total spent skill points are displayed alongside total gained skill points. Each Skill item the character has is displayed can be edited, reordered, and its skill check rolled.</p><h1>Traits</h1><h3>Formulae</h3><p>Here is where the calculations are defined for maximum CHP, XHP, ML, and basic Encumbrance. These are usually modified by active effects from Feature items, but they can be manually adjusted as well.</p><h3>Modifiers</h3><p>Here is where the total modifiers for BAB, Initiative, and Recoil Reduction are displayed alongside the corresponding inputs for miscellaneous modifiers. The dropdown for Initiative Wagering is also present here, and automatically applies to initiative and attack.</p><h3>Character Option Points</h3><p>Here is where the player applies the effects from their spent C.O.P.s during character creation and leveling up.

Error range is displayed for weapons, and the percentile chance for jamming potential can be rolled. Ammunition or other resource expenditure is displayed and potentially editable.</p><p>To the right each action displays its check, effect (if applicable), and any resources consumed by the check.</p><h1>Defense</h1><h3>Defense Modifiers</h3><p>The various factors that contribute to defense are editable here. Dodge, Equipment, and Miscellaneous are shown as totals alongside their miscellaneous inputs since they rely on other properties and can be targeted by active effects.</p><h3>Defense Impacts</h3><p>The total penalties incurred by every active piece of Armor present on the character. Max Agility automatically applies to the ability modifier, Armor Penalty is referenced by skills marked as sensitive to it, and CP Loss is available to deduct in the header.</p><h3>Extremity Damage</h3><p>A set of simple clickable toggles to mark whether a given limb is wounded or not. Purely for reference.</p><h3>Damage and Hit Points</h3><p>The number of bleed dice can be input and then rolled, applying it to the incoming damage. Incoming Damage itself is a Delta Input, and by right clicking a roll message with a token selected you can add its value to the incoming damage as well. The notes field is for reference.</p><h3>Magical Protection, Plasma Shielding, Armor Plates, Worn Armor, Other Protection, and Inactive Protection</h3><p>Each Armor item the character has is displayed here in its relevant category and can be edited or reordered. Their current Armor Points or Soak can also be edited, and for armors with different kinds of protection the currently-applicable Damage Reduction can be selected.</p><h3>Applying Damage</h3><p>The icons accompanying XHP, CHP, and each Armor will take the incoming damage amount and apply it to the associated value depending on its type.</p><ul><li><p>XHP can't be negative, but CHP can.</p></li><li><p>Any Armor without a defined Armor Point/Soak maximum is treated as simple Damage Reduction, reducing the incoming damage.</p></li><li><p>Plasma Shielding applies its DR to the incoming damage first, potentially diffusing it entirely before starting to lose Soak.</p></li><li><p>All other Armors with defined pools of Armor Points spend their AP to reduce the incoming damage using their DR.</p></li><li><p>A dialog may pop up asking if the attacker is doing something special that would impact the damage application.

Miscellaneous costs can come from active effects or the provided input. Whether a character is psionically focused or memorizing a set of incantation recipes can be toggled. Temporary ML from drugs or other sources can be input. ML spent by invoking can be manually edited but will usually be altered by actions that spend it, and the icon will refund the amount that an invoker naturally regains every round.

To replace the value in these kinds of inputs, begin your entry with =. These inputs will automatically highlight their content when selected to help enter these delta inputs.</p><h3>Clickable Elements</h3><p>Parts of the sheet that 'do something' when clicked will highlight when moused over and generally be bold.</p><h3>Embedded Items</h3><p>Anywhere you can click to edit an item, you can right-click for additional options. You can create a duplicate of the item inside the actor, or copy it to the world sidebar itself. This is useful when setting up multiple similar items or ones that can be used by multiple characters.</p><h3>Checks, Effects, and Resource Consumption</h3><p>Available actions on the character sheet are often divided between a 'check' and an 'effect' roll. If the action consumes resources, the check will be what actually consumes them. To avoid consuming resources, hold <code>alt</code> when clicking on the check roll. To ignore any warnings about insufficient resources and potentially end up with negative numbers, hold <code>ctrl</code> when clicking on the check roll. To skip the dialog for adding/modifying situational modifiers, hold <code>shift</code> when clicking on the check roll.</p><h1>Sheet Header</h1><h3>Name and Token Image</h3><p>Newly-created actors will have a randomly-assigned icon for their image. So long as the token image is one of the random possibilities, updating it will update the prototype token image just like the default behavior in other systems.</p><h3>Health</h3><p>XHP and CHP are both Delta Inputs. They can also be altered by applying damage to them on the Defense tab. The Temp field is for reference and not used in calculations.</p><h3>Combat Points</h3><p>CP is a Delta Input. It can also be altered by the resource consumption of actions. The Max field is for reference and not used in calculations. The Temp field is used to determine how many Combat Points past zero can be spent without warning. Loss is derived from active Armor and can be deducted from the current value.</p><h3>Defense</h3><p>Defense, Flat-Footed Defense, and Touch Defense are all derived from other properties and shown here for easy reference.</p><h1>Character</h1><h3>Ability Scores</h3><p>The ability modifier for the six core abilities is calculated and displayed on the right. For the two ability scores with split modifiers, Strength and Dexterity, inputting the modifier for the Focus and Marksmanship will allocate the rest of the ability's modifier to Power and Agility, respectively. The labels are all rollable as generic ability checks.</p><h3>Saving Throws</h3><p>By expanding each display, you can edit the multiplier applied to each base save or input an arbitrary modifier. The main labels themselves are rollable.</p><h3>Skills</h3><p>Total spent skill points are displayed alongside total gained skill points. Each Skill item the character has is displayed can be edited, reordered, and its skill check rolled.</p><h1>Traits</h1><h3>Formulae</h3><p>Here is where the calculations are defined for maximum CHP, XHP, ML, and basic Encumbrance. These are usually modified by active effects from Feature items, but they can be manually adjusted as well.</p><h3>Modifiers</h3><p>Here is where the total modifiers for BAB, Initiative, and Recoil Reduction are displayed alongside the corresponding inputs for miscellaneous modifiers. The dropdown for Initiative Wagering is also present here, and automatically applies to initiative and attack.</p><h3>Character Option Points</h3><p>Here is where the player applies the effects from their spent C.O.P.s during character creation and leveling up. Each input field is for the total effect of any spent points, not for the points themselves.</p><h3>Traits and Feats</h3><p>Each Feature item the character has is displayed with its summary for reference and can be edited or reordered.</p><h1>Offense</h1><h3>Weapons, Objects, and Magic</h3><p>All display mostly the same information for the three different item types All Weapons are displayed, and any Objects or Magics with attack-type actions are also shown. Within each category the items can be edited, reordered, or minimized.</p><p>Critical threat range is displayed if applicable. Error range is displayed for weapons, and the percentile chance for jamming potential can be rolled. Ammunition or other resource expenditure is displayed and potentially editable.</p><p>To the right each action displays its check, effect (if applicable), and any resources consumed by the check.</p><h1>Defense</h1><h3>Defense Modifiers</h3><p>The various factors that contribute to defense are editable here. Dodge, Equipment, and Miscellaneous are shown as totals alongside their miscellaneous inputs since they rely on other properties and can be targeted by active effects.</p><h3>Defense Impacts</h3><p>The total penalties incurred by every active piece of Armor present on the character. Max Agility automatically applies to the ability modifier, Armor Penalty is referenced by skills marked as sensitive to it, and CP Loss is available to deduct in the header.</p><h3>Extremity Damage</h3><p>A set of simple clickable toggles to mark whether a given limb is wounded or not. Purely for reference.</p><h3>Damage and Hit Points</h3><p>The number of bleed dice can be input and then rolled, applying it to the incoming damage. Incoming Damage itself is a Delta Input, and by right clicking a roll message with a token selected you can add its value to the incoming damage as well. The notes field is for reference.</p><h3>Magical Protection, Plasma Shielding, Armor Plates, Worn Armor, Other Protection, and Inactive Protection</h3><p>Each Armor item the character has is displayed here in its relevant category and can be edited or reordered. Their current Armor Points or Soak can also be edited, and for armors with different kinds of protection the currently-applicable Damage Reduction can be selected.</p><h3>Applying Damage</h3><p>The icons accompanying XHP, CHP, and each Armor will take the incoming damage amount and apply it to the associated value depending on its type.</p><ul><li><p>XHP can't be negative, but CHP can.</p></li><li><p>Any Armor without a defined Armor Point/Soak maximum is treated as simple Damage Reduction, reducing the incoming damage.</p></li><li><p>Plasma Shielding applies its DR to the incoming damage first, potentially diffusing it entirely before starting to lose Soak.</p></li><li><p>All other Armors with defined pools of Armor Points spend their AP to reduce the incoming damage using their DR.</p></li><li><p>A dialog may pop up asking if the attacker is doing something special that would impact the damage application. Hold <code>shift</code> when clicking the icon to skip these.</p></li></ul><p>Each 'step' of applying the same chunk of damage will output its result to a chat message. Until the incoming damage is reduced entirely or another chat message interrupts, the same message is updated with each step.</p><h1>Utility</h1><h3>Mental Limit</h3><p>The various factors that contribute to Mental Limit usage and capacity are displayed here. Miscellaneous costs can come from active effects or the provided input. Whether a character is psionically focused or memorizing a set of incantation recipes can be toggled. Temporary ML from drugs or other sources can be input. ML spent by invoking can be manually edited but will usually be altered by actions that spend it, and the icon will refund the amount that an invoker naturally regains every round. Mental limit from objects is derived from all objects with a magic resource that has an ML cost and nonzero uses remaining.</p><h3>Resources</h3><p>Items with available resources will be listed here for easy reference and editing.</p><ul><li><p>Quantity is only available or even displayed if marked as available.</p></li><li><p>Consumable resources must be marked available for use.</p></li><li><p>Coolant resources are always available for selection, but can be marked as cool or hot.</p></li><li><p>Magic resources are always available for selection, and can optionally incur a ML cost when they have nonzero uses.</p></li><li><p>Generic resources are for reference only.</p></li></ul><h3>Character</h3><p>A list of general actions a character can perform along with their Combat Point costs and an arbitrary multiplier. Clicking the icon will deduct the total CP cost from the character.</p><h3>Objects</h3><p>Objects with utility actions will be listed here in much the same fashion as on the Offense tab.</p><h3>Magic</h3><p>All Magic items will be listed here in much the same fashion as on the Offense tab.</p><h1>Gear</h1><h3>Money</h3><p>Three fields are included for tracking wealth points if a single number isn't enough. All three are Delta Inputs, and the labels are simply suggestions. The notes are for reference. The income formula can be rolled by clicking the accompanying icon.</p><h3>Encumbrance</h3><p>Displays the light, medium, and heavy load capacity based on the formulae and any other effects.</p><h3>Capital</h3><p>Displays how much Personal Capital the character would have based on their Charisma score and Level, as well as inputs for any External Capital and how much each of those are tied up in hard assets.</p><h3>Loose Items, Worn Items, Carried Items, and Stored Items</h3><p>Each organizational category tallies the total weight of objects inside it. Items are displayed with their icons and any items that are nested within them, and can be edited or reordered.</p><h1>Biography</h1><p>Race and Size are often set by Active Effect but can be manually set. Everything except Level is purely for reference; Level is used to calculate the character's Base Attack Bonus.</p><h1>Active Effects</h1><h3>Temporary Effects, Passive Effects, and Inactive Effects</h3><p>Displays Every Active Effect present on the Character, as well as where it comes from. Each can be toggled active or inactive, edited, or deleted</p><h3>Unfiltered Item List</h3><p>Provided as a failsafe in case a misbehaving item isn't showing up anywhere else or can't be opened to delete it.</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}},{"sort":0,"name":"Item Types","type":"text","_id":"tfnsjIc7mbPxH1j4","title":{"show":true,"level":1},"image":{},"text":{"format":1,"content":"<h1>Common Concepts</h1><p>When owned by a character, a trash icon will be present in the item's own sheet in order to delete it.</p><h3>Physical Objects</h3><p>Weapons, Objects, and some Armors are 'physical objects' with a common set of properties. They have a Quantity, Size, Weight, Cost, Quality, License, Container, and Note. Quantity can potentially be uses as a resource, and it also affects the total displayed weight when owned by a character. Weight can be toggled between pounds and tons by clicking the icon. Cost can be toggled between wealth points and capital by clicking the icon.
