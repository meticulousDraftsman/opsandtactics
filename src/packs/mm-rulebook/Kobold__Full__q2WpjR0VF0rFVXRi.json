    "description": "<h3>Racial Traits</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Kobolds are Small sized creatures. They gain &nbsp;&minus;1 size penalty to all melee attack rolls.</li>\n<li>Kobolds can not use Colossal or Gargantuan sized weapons, take a &minus;6 attack penalty when using all Huge weapons, take a &minus;2 attack penalty when using all Large sized weapons and take a &minus;1 attack penalty when using all Medium sized weapons.</li>\n<li>Kobolds can communicate entirely without any kind of verbal communication, through the use of fine, rapid nose twitches.</li>\n<li>Kobolds possess Darkvision, which allows them to see in total darkness, out to 50 feet. This vision is black-and-white only.</li>\n<li>Kobolds have Receptive Healing. They heal at twice the normal amount from all medicinal and magical healing, and heal twice as fast through normal healing.</li>\n<li>Kobolds are weak to Cold Environments. The Fortitude Saving Throw to resist cold environments is doubled.</li>\n<li>Kobolds have Alternate Biochemistry. They gain no benefit from using standard medicines and pharmaceuticals, and instead must have specific pharmaceuticals made for Dragons. All medicines, drugs, and pharmaceuticals for Dragons cost twice as much and when crafting pharmaceuticals for Dragons, the TN is increased by +6.</li>\n<li>Kobolds possess Low-Light Vision, giving them the ability to recognize color and read in near total darkness.</li>\n<li>Kobolds possess Blindsight, which allows them to fight in total lack of visibility, either through environment or lack of sight. This ability has a 35&rsquo; range.</li>\n<li>Kobolds gain a +4 to all Perception checks that can take use of their Scent ability.</li>\n<li>Kobolds possess the Scent ability, which allows them to detect approaching enemies, sniff out hidden foes, and track by sense of smell. Races with the Scent ability can identify familiar odors. The creature can detect any object or creature that has an odor within 150 feet by sense of smell. If the object or creature is upwind, the range increases to 300 feet; if downwind, it drops to 75 feet. Strong odors can be detected at twice the ranges noted above. Overpowering odors can be detected at triple normal range. When an odor is detected, the exact location is not revealed&mdash;only its presence somewhere within range. If the kobold moves within 30 feet of the source, they can pinpoint that source.</li>\n<li>Kobolds have Kobalthwyn as their native language and receive Trade Bant Simplified as a secondary language.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Racial Traits (Active Effect)</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Kobolds are Small sized creatures. They gain a +1 size bonus to Defense.</li>\n<li>When calculating the carrying capacity for a kobold, multiply all carrying capacity values by .50. This carrying capacity reduction includes the calculation for small creatures.</li>\n<li>Kobolds have a base Combat Point score of 18.</li>\n<li>Kobolds CHP formula is <code>CON Score -2</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Dragons</h3>\n<p>All dragons have tails that can be targeted. They have the same targeting rules as legs. Any armor that provides protection to legs, will also provide protection to tails.</p>\n<h3>Physical Description</h3>\n<p>A healthy kobold typically stands between 3&frac34;-4&frac12;&rsquo;, and weighs between 90-140 lbs. The males are slightly larger than the females. Male and female Kobolds gain large ears as they reach adulthood. Kobolds have thin scales covering their body, which are usually a light green to a dark brown color. Kobolds do not have hair. The average Kobold lifespan is 80 years, reaching physical adulthood between the ages of 14-16.</p>\n<h3>Language</h3>\n<p>The native language of a Kobold is Kobalthwyn. They will often speak Trade Bant Simplified.</p>\n<h3>Names</h3>\n<p>Kobolds have a rather unique naming system, in which their name constantly changes, due to any changing circumstances, or events that happen with the kobold. The Kobold will have to refer to his old names when reuniting with old friends and acquaintances, to update them. Usually, these names are flattering to the kobold, but some can be less than flattering. Non-kobolds will usually refer to the first name they know the kobold by, to no offense to the kobold.</p>",
