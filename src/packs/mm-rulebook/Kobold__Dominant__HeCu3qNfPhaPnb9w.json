The Kobold will have to refer to his old names when reuniting with old friends and acquaintances, to update them. Usually, these names are flattering to the kobold, but some can be less than flattering. Non-kobolds will usually refer to the first name they know the kobold by, to no offense to the kobold.</p>",
