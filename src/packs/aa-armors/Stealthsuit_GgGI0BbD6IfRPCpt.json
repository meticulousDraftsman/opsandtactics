    "description": "<p>A stealthsuit is a full bodysuit that is littered with tiny LEDs and sensors that adapt to whatever is nearby. When a character wearing this armor stops moving for 1 round, the armor shifts its colors that not only mirror the surrounding area, but compliment it as well. When this happens, the character wearing the armor gains an immediate +18 bonus on all Stealth checks to avoid being seen. The armor can also be used to blend in the open, causing a slight optical illusion and an appearance of invisibility. When the armor is worn normally, it grants a 15% Concealment bonus against all ranged attacks.</p>\n<h3>Special Notes</h3>\n<p>This armor protects the head, arms, legs, feet and hands of the wearer, providing DR and Defense to all listed areas.</p>",
