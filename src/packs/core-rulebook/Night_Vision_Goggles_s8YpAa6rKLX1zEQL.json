    "description": "<p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Night vision goggles are goggles that use passive light gathering to improve vision in near-dark and dark conditions. They grant the user the ability to see in darkness, but because of the restricted view, grant a -5 penalty to all sight based perception checks made by someone wearing them. When in complete darkness, NVGs must either be used with an infrared illuminator (+8 to the cost), or use another source of infrared light. Using either of these sources of infrared light grants fully illuminated vision as normal</span>.</p>"
