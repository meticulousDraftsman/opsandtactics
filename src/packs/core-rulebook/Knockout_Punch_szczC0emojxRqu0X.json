If this attack is successful the character gains +4 damage dice. After the attack is made the character is considered Flat-Footed for a single round. This damage is non-lethal damage.</span></p><h3>Special</h3><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Even if the character has the ability to treat unarmed damage as lethal damage, the damage from a knockout punch is always non-lethal</span>.</p>",
