    "description": "<h3>Aetherweapons</h3><p>Aetherweapons are split into three categories based on their capacity; Aetherrods, Aetherstaves, and Aetherwands, which are magical objects that have been formatted by an enchantment spell to receive spells and recast them as if they were cast from a mage. When a aetherweapon has completely expended all of its spell uses it returns to normal and has to be reformatted again and then re-enchanted. Aetherweapons are considered simple weapons. Unlike written spells, they can be cast by anyone, usually by either pressing a sigil, or by speaking a command word, which is usually printed on the object.</p><h3>Aetherstaves</h3><p>A staff can be created from any rod-like object that is between 37’’-72’’. An Aetherstave can hold three spells which can be used a combined 30 times before it has to be reformatted and re- enchanted. Use of any spell uses one of the uses that the staff has. The staff listed in the chart is a pre-formatted six foot long staff made of oak.</p>"
