For the purpose of this feat, all shell calibers are under a single category, all black powder calibers are under a single category, and all caseless calibers are under a single category.</p><h3>Prerequisites </h3><p>Personal Firearms Proficiency or Black Powder Firearm Proficiency</p><h3>Benefit </h3><p>When using the caliber, the CRP is multiplied by 0.75, rounded down. This reduction is calculated after any ammunition modifications that may raise or lower the Caliber Recoil Penalty, but not before any recoil reducing modifications on the firearm. When reloading a batch of ammunition of this caliber, they receive a +8 bonus on their craft check, and reduce any error chance from using this ammunition by 15%. When Enchanting ammunition of this caliber, reduce the SP cost of the spell by 2.</p><h3>Special </h3><p>A character may take this feat multiple times. Each time the character takes the feat, they select a different category.</p>",
